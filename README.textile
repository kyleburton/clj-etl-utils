h1. clj-etl-utils

The master branc is for Clojure 1.3 suport.  All clj-etl-utils versions released from this branch shall have a 1.3.x version numbering scheme.  Clojure 1.2 support will be on the clojure-1.2 branch.

h2. Testing

ETL Utilities for Clojure.  This library began with functions that worked with data on disk, such as database dumps and log files, at least that was the original purpose of the library, it has since grown to include other utilities.

h2. Modules

h3. clj-etl-utils.http

This is a wrapper around Apache Jakarta Commons HttpClent.  This is yet another http client library for clojure.  This implementation is not attempting to be dependency free (as are many of the other clojure http client libraries).  It is merely a convienience wrapper around the Jakarta Commons HttpClient.  I need to utilize many of the common features that user agents typically support such as: cookies, automatically following redirects, basic authentication including realms, automatic form encoding, posting non-form url encoded data, etc.  Jakart's HTTP Client fits this feature set very well, thought its api is not brief - this library attempts to make it more convienient to use without limiting access to any of its advanced features.

h4. User Agent

Creating a user agent is done by calling the @(user-agent)@ function.  It accepts two paramters: @:follow-redirects@ which controls whether or not it follows HTTP redirect responses to the pointed to locations; and @:basic-auth@ which allows you to supply authorization credentials for HTTP's basic auth system.

bc.. (ws/get  (user-agent) url :params {:foo "bar"})
(ws/post (user-agent) url :params {:foo "bar"})
(ws/post (user-agent) url :body "this is the body" :content-type "text/plain")
(ws/post (user-agent) url :body "<xml? ...>"       :content-type "text/xml")

(defonce *ua* (user-agent :follow-redirects :true
                          ;; defaults to Realm/ANY, you can override with :realm value
                          :basic-auth {:user "bob" :pass "sekret"}))

(let [req (ws/get-req url :params {:foo "bar"})]
  (ws/get *ua* req))

(let [req (ws/get-req url :params {:foo "bar"})]
  (ws/get *ua* req))

(ws/post *ua* url :params {:foo "bar"})
(ws/post *ua* url :body "this is the body" :content-type "text/plain")

h3. clj-etl-utils.io

IO and File utilities.

h4. string-reader, string-input-stream

Returns a Reader or an InputStream, respectively, that will read from the given string.

h4. read-fixed-length-string

Reads a fixed-length string.

h4. chmod

Changes the permissions on a file by shelling out to the @chmod@ command.

h4. mkdir

Creates the given directory, just returning true if the given directory already exists (as opposed to throwing an exception).

h4. exists?

Tests if a file exists.

h4. symlink

Establishes a symlink for a file.

h4. freeze, thaw

freeze invokes the java serialization and returns a byte array.  Thaw does the opposite: takes a byte array and deserializes it.

h4. object->file

Uses Java serialization to write an object to the given file, truncating if it exists.

h4. file->object

Deserializes a serialized object from a file.

h4. ensure-directory

Ensures a directory path exists (recursively), doing nothing if it already exists.

h4. string-gzip

Compress a string, returning the bytes.

h4. byte-partitions-at-line-boundaries

This can be used in divide and conquer scenarios where you want to process different segments of a single file in parallel.  It takes an input file name and a desired block size.  Block boundaries will be close to the desired size - the size is used as a seek position, any line remnant present at that position is read, such that a given block will end cleanly at a line boundary.

h4. random-access-file-line-seq-with-limit

Returns a lazy sequence of lines from a RandomAccessFile up to a given limit.  If a line spans the limit, the entire line will be returned, so that a valid line is always returned.

h4. read-lines-from-file-segment

Returns a sequence of lines from the file across the given starting and ending positions.

h3. clj-etl-utils.landmark_parser

h3. clj-etl-utils.lang

@lang/make-periodic-invoker@ can be used to easily create 'progress' indicators or bars

h4. Example

pre.. (let [total   1000
      period   100
      progress (lang/make-periodic-invoker
                 period
                 (fn [val & [is-done]]
                   (if (= is-done :done)
                     (printf "All Done! %d\n" val)
                     (printf "So far we did %d, we are  %3.2f%% complete.\n" val (* 100.0 (/ val 1.0 total))))))]
  (dotimes [ii total]
    ;; do some work / processing here
    (progress))
  (progress :final :done))

p. Produces the following output:

pre.. So far we did 100, we are  10.00% complete.
So far we did 200, we are  20.00% complete.
So far we did 300, we are  30.00% complete.
So far we did 400, we are  40.00% complete.
So far we did 500, we are  50.00% complete.
So far we did 600, we are  60.00% complete.
So far we did 700, we are  70.00% complete.
So far we did 800, we are  80.00% complete.
So far we did 900, we are  90.00% complete.
So far we did 1000, we are  100.00% complete.
All Done! 1000

h3. clj-etl-utils.log

h3. clj-etl-utils.ref_data

h3. clj-etl-utils.regex

h3. clj-etl-utils.sequences

h3. clj-etl-utils.text

h3. clj-etl-utils.indexer

Module for working with line-oriented data files in-situ on disk.  These tools allow you to create (somewhat) arbitrary indexes into a file and walk through the indexed values.

h4. Example

Given the tab delimited file @file.txt@:

pre.. 99	line with larger key
1	is is the second line
2	this is a line
3	this is another line
99	duplicated line for key

p. We can create an index on the @id@ column id:

pre.. (index-file! "file.txt" ".file.txt.id-idx" #(first (.split % "\t")))

p. That index can then be used to read groups of records from the file with
the same key values:

pre.. (record-blocks-via-index "file.txt" ".file.txt.id-idx")

pre.. ( [ "1\tis is the second line" ]
[ "2\tthis is a line" ]
[ "3\tthis is another line" ]
[ "99\tline with larger key"
"99\tduplicated line for key" ] )
